## Summary

AUDIT, Analysis & evalUation Dashboard of artIficial inTelligence, is a tool designed to provide
researchers and developers with an interactive way to better analyze and explore MRI datasets and segmentation models.
Given its functionalities to extract the most relevant features and metrics from your multiple data sources, it
allows for uncovering biases both intra and inter-dataset as well as in the model predictions.

Details of our work are provided in our paper [*AUDIT: An open-source Python library for AI model evaluation with use cases in MRI brain tumor segmentation*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2025.108991). We hope that users will leverage AUDIT to gain novel insights into the field of medical image segmentation.

## AUDIT workflow

The diagram below illustrates the overall workflow of AUDIT, from input data to data visualization on the APP.

For more details, please refer to the AUDIT paper.

## AUDIT analysis modes:

- **Home Page**: The main landing page of the tool.
- **Univariate**: Exploration of individual features to understand how they are distributed.
- **Multivariate**: Analysis of multiple features simultaneously to explore relationships and hidden patterns.
- **Segmentation error matrix**: Overview of disagreements between ground truth and predicted segmentation through a class-wise error matrix.
- **Single model performance**: Evaluation of the performance of a single model based on extracted features.
- **Pairwise model performance**: Perform pairwise comparisons between models to find statistically significant differences.
- **Multi-model performance**: Comparative analysis of performance metrics across multiple models.
- **Longitudinal measurements**: Analysis of data collected over time to observe trends and changes in model performance.
- **Subjects' exploration**: Detailed examination of individual subjects within the dataset.

## Online Web application

Last released version of **AUDIT** is hosted at https://auditapp.streamlitapp.com for an online overview of its functionalities.

## Getting Started

AUDIT can be installed either from our GitHub repository or from PyPI using the command _pip install auditapp_. In this guide, we will show how to install it from the GitHub repository.
For a more detailed exploration of AUDIT, please check our [*official documentation*](https://caumente.github.io/AUDIT/getting_started/getting_started/).

### 1 Installation 

Create an isolated Anaconda environment (recommended to avoid dependency conflicts):

```bash
conda create -n audit_env python=3.10
conda activate audit_env
```

Clone the repository:
 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/caumente/AUDIT.git
 cd AUDIT
 ```

Install the required packages:
 ```bash
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```

### 2. Configuration

Edit the config files in `./src/audit/configs/` directory to set up the paths for data loading and other configurations:

### 3. Run AUDIT backend

Use the following commands in your terminal to run the *Feature extraction* and *Metric extraction* scripts:

```bash
python src/audit/feature_extraction.py
```

```bash
python src/audit/metric_extraction.py
```

After running either script, a _logs_ folder will be created to keep track of the execution. All output files will be stored in the folder defined in the corresponding config file (by default, in the _outputs_ folder).

### 4. Run AUDIT app

AUDIT app is built on top of the Streamlit library. Use the following command to run the app and start exploring your data:

```bash
python src/audit/app/launcher.py
```

### 5. Additional configurations

#### 5.1. ITK-Snap

AUDIT can be adjusted for opening cases with ITK-Snap while exploring the data in the different dashboards. The 
ITK-Snap tool must have been installed and preconfigured before. Here we provide a simple necessary configuration to 
use it in each operative system:

  <summary><strong>5.1.1. On Mac OS</strong></summary>

<details>
  <summary><strong>5.1.2. On Linux OS</strong></summary>
