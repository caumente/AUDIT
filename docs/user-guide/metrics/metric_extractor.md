[//]: # (::: src.metrics.custom_metrics)


This `metric extraction` pipeline processes MRI segmentation data by comparing ground truth segmentations with model 
predictions to compute a variety of metrics. The pipeline supports both custom metrics and Pymia-based metrics, with 
the ability to handle multiple models and datasets. The two main components of the pipeline are metric_extractor.py, 
which serves as the entry point, and main.py, which contains the core logic for metric computation.

The pipeline operates as follows:

- **Configuration and Logging**: The pipeline begins by loading a configuration file, which defines the dataset paths, 
models, metrics to be extracted, and output settings. Logging is set up to track the progress and output detailed logs.

- **Metric Extraction**: Depending on the configuration, the pipeline can compute either custom metrics (using methods 
defined in the project) or Pymia metrics (using the Pymia library for medical image analysis). 
  
  - Custom Metrics: This approach calculates specific metrics like Dice coefficient, sensitivity, or others based on 
  custom implementations. It involves one-hot encoding the ground truth and predicted segmentations and then computing 
  the defined metrics for each patient.
  
  - Pymia Metrics: The pipeline can leverage Pymia's built-in metrics (e.g., Hausdorff distance, Dice coefficient, 
  Jaccard index) for segmentation evaluation. Pymia's evaluator processes the segmentation files and accumulates the 
  results across different models and regions.


- **Data Processing**: For each dataset and model, metrics are computed for all patients. The results are collected 
into a DataFrame, and if longitudinal data is involved, it can further organize the results by time points.

- **Output and Statistics**: The extracted metrics are stored as CSV files, and additional statistical analyses (e.g., 
mean, median, standard deviation) can be computed and saved if required. The output is structured and ready for 
further analysis or reporting.

This pipeline provides a flexible and scalable solution for evaluating segmentation models, making it suitable for 
multi-model comparisons and performance tracking across different datasets.
